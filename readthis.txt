When deciding which sequence is best for your essay, always consider the reader. What sequence will best fit your
reader's needs. If that reader is your teacher, she may have provided you with some instructions on how she expects
you to organize  your essay. Follow them. If you are writing for publication, consider the writer's guidelines, which
may outline specific organizational patterns they consider best for their readers. If you are writing for yourself,
imagine your own readership. Picture what your perfect reader would need, but balance it against what your harshest
critic might need to change his mind about your essay.
